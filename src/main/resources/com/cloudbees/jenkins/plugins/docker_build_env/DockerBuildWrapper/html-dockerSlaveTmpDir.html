Define the path that should be used to volume bind the slave's <code>/tmp</code> directory (as defined by
the <code>java.io.tmpdir</code> system property).
<p>
    This is useful if the Jenkins slave itself is running inside Docker. In order for it to successfully
    share its <code>/tmp</code> directory with the build container, both must be volume-bound from
    a directory on the Docker host. This setting specifies the host path of that directory.
</p>
<p>
    Example : <code>/var/lib/jenkins_tmp</code>
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the Jenkins slave running in Docker must also be configured to volume-bind the
    same temporary directory to its <code>/tmp</code> (or whatever <code>java.io.tmpdir</code> points to).
