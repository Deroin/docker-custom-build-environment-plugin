<p>
    Define the path that should be used to volume bind the slave's Jenkins root (<code>JENKINS_HOME</code>).
</p>
<p>
    This is useful if the Jenkins node running the job is itself running inside Docker, and the path to the
    host directory is different from the volume mount point inside the container.
</p>
<p>
    Example : <code>/var/lib/jenkins_home</code>
